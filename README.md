# Jelly Blobs of Doom

Jelly Blobs of Doom is a game made with Tkinter for the CS 111 final project. In order to win, the player 
(the blue blob) must eat the jelly blobs smaller than itself in order to grow. It must avoid being eaten 
by the blobs larger than itself or else it will shrink. Shrinking too much will lose the game, while growing
to a certain size will win the game.
